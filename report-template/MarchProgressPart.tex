\section{Progress Since Last Report}
\label{sec-1}
Since my last report I changed my decision about web technology to an
implementaion in Racket. The rationale for this decision is that
Racket provides built-in capabilities for both website production and
database interaction. This provides an ideal framework for a project
like this. Using Racket, I have constructed a simple website that views all donors
fetched from the database. I have laid down a database-website
interaction framework that enables future developments. What I have
not accomplished is populating randomized disease lists, tests done,
addresses. Additionally, the website lacks user search and user match
capability.

I have elected to postpone the completion of data population for two reasons: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item This is a minimal set of data that could exist in a real
situation; name, phone, bloodtype.
\item Until I develop search capabilities, the data is unnecessary and
thus does not detract from current development.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Problems I'm Having}
\label{sec-2}
I am having issues with developing an effective and aesthetically
pleasing display for the donor list. A simple way to accomplish this
is in Javascript, but Racket documentation about using Racket to
produce Javascript is sparse. Until I get a grasp on the Javascript
aspect I cannot make progress, so that is a very high-priority goal. I
do not anticipate needing support from teaching faculty to accomplish this.
\section{What I Plan To Do About It}
\label{sec-3}
I am considering a paradigm similar to those of other web stacks such
as PHP/Javascript integration, or CGI approaches, which generate the
output HTML according to a host language, but embed Javascript for
advanced operations like jQuery.
